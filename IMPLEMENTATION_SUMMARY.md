## Technology Stack Breakdown

### TypeScript/NestJS (6 services + gateway)
- **Framework:** NestJS
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Purpose:** Business logic, rapid development, type sharing

### Go (3 services)
- **Framework:** Fiber
- **Language:** Go 1.21+
- **Purpose:** High-performance, concurrent operations, low latency

### C#/.NET (2 services)
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core
- **Language:** C# (.NET 8.0)
- **Purpose:** Data aggregation, reporting, strong typing

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Service Discovery
- API Gateway maintains a registry of all services
- Each service has metadata (name, URL, language, purpose)

### 2. Routing
- All requests go through the API Gateway
- Gateway routes to appropriate backend services
- RESTful API endpoints for each service

### 3. Health Checks
- Every service has a `/health` endpoint
- Gateway aggregates service health status

### 4. Containerization
- Docker support for all services
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Multi-stage builds for optimization

### 5. Development Tools
- Startup script for easy local development
- Environment variable templates
- Service-specific READMEs

## How to Use

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: First-Time Setup

This is a **pnpm workspace/monorepo**. You MUST install dependencies from the root:

```bash
# From the root directory
cd /path/to/bilo-repo
pnpm install  # ✅ Installs all service dependencies at once
```

**DO NOT** run `pnpm install` inside individual service directories - it won't work!

See [MONOREPO_SETUP.md](./MONOREPO_SETUP.md) for detailed explanation.

### Quick Start
```bash
# First, install dependencies (if not done already)
pnpm install

# Check prerequisites
./start-services.sh check

# Start all services
./start-services.sh all

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up
```

### Access the Gateway
```bash
# View all services
curl http://localhost:3000/services

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Test Individual Services
```bash
# TypeScript service
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Auth Service

# Go service
curl http://localhost:3100/health  # Transactions Service

# .NET service
curl http://localhost:3200/health  # Portfolio Service
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Polyglot:** Each service uses the best language for its purpose
2. **Scalable:** Services can be scaled independently
3. **Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns
4. **Resilient:** Failure isolation between services
5. **Developer-Friendly:** Teams can work in their preferred languages
6. **Performance-Optimized:** Right tool for the right job

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Install dependencies for each service
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up databases (if needed)
4. Test individual services

### Short-term
1. Implement actual HTTP proxy logic in API Gateway
2. Add authentication middleware
3. Set up logging and monitoring
4. Configure CI/CD pipelines

### Medium-term
1. Implement service-to-service authentication
2. Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
3. Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
4. Implement circuit breaker patterns

### Long-term
1. Kubernetes deployment
2. Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
3. Distributed tracing
4. Advanced observability
