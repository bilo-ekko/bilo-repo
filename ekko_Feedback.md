### RAG check:

Red (red)
Amber (amber)
Green (green)

Feedback (areas to improve):

**Ryan**

- When seeming a bit overwhelmed, (e.g. conversations in standup, etc.)
    - those are just conversations, but not necessarily a shift in priorities or criteria

- Slow down a bit and deliver with higher quality, measure twice, cut once

**Etienne**

- Ideally: less push back from Maria & Lena
    - When handing over work, be more specific about what you're expecting to be tested, explicitly.
- Take more risks.
    - In discussions, be more active & inquisitive in meetings even when lacking context
    - Challenge myself to challenge the team a bit more, push back a bit more, think critically.
